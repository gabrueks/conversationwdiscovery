# conversationwdiscovery
My very first project with Node.js so it's kinda of unorganized.<br>
To run the application, go to your command line and run the commands: <br>
> git clone https://github.com/gabrueks/conversationwdiscovery.git <br>
> cd conversationwdiscovery <br>
> npm install <br>
> npm start <br>

The application is now running, go to your browser and acess: localhost:3000
